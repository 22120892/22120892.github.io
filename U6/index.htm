<p class="img-pad2">In today's world, websites are essential in order to provide and establish an effective business and demographics.</p>
<p class="img-pad2">It is impossible for an organisation to handle and rise in popularity
without having a website of their own.</p>

<p class="img-pad2">This is why websites need to be fully functioning, accurate to what the company or brand is trying to represent 
and have the correct tools to make a positive user experience when navigating through the website.
Nowadays, a website plays a huge role into how an organisation is seen. As the internet is growing bigger, more users are included.<p>
<p class="img-pad2">An organisation needs to make sure that their website is professional and well presented as it is the same as giving a good service to a customer.</p>
<p class="img-pad2">There tend to be different types of websites based on differnet organisations.</p><p class="img-pad2">
 It is essential to find the website trend of your organisation and harness its
structure and its way of presenting information. An alternative to this could be to create your own website nature. This makes your website unique 
and potentially overcoming other websites.</p>
