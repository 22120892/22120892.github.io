As technology improves, the expectations and abilities of the IT world increase.

This means jobs that involve digital technology tend to change.

The requirements to make a website now expect a website developer

 to apply their techniques more effectively and efficiently.

As many people of different demographics now have access to the internet.

Not all of them have the same computational skills or reading skills.

This can be done by adding an easy to read font, a visually appealing background, simple vocabulary and accessibility alternatives.
