                <p>What is web developing ?</p>

<p>Website developing is mainly refering around the skilled process of maintining, creating, testing, inspiring and ensuring for a functioning website. This includes many different processes such as coding, scripting or CMS
development.</p>

<p> Web development has gained the view of more than just a markup or coding. It is seen as an art form and one of the ways of bringing your ideas to life. Website development
also ensures that accessibility and simplicity are present. Along with the coding and markup, Accessibility, client side scripting, content management and server side scripting are also considered.
